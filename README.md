## Hi there 👋 I’m **Olusegun Ekundayo Adebayo**

### 🧬 About Me

I am a **Bioinformatician and Postdoctoral Researcher** at **Collège de France (CIRB – Denis Duboule Lab)**, working on **chromatin organization and developmental gene regulation** using large-scale **2D/3D multi-omics datasets**.

I recently completed my **PhD in Applied Mathematics** at **Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté**, where I combined **Python, machine learning, deep learning, and mathematical modeling** to study **keloid disease dynamics and medical image classification**.

My work sits at the intersection of **bioinformatics, Python-based data science, machine learning, mathematical modeling, and computational biology**, with a strong focus on **reproducible, scalable, and automated Python pipelines**.
