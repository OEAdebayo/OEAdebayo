### About Me

I am currently a third-year doctoral student at the BesanÃ§on Mathematics Laboratory (LmB), University of Franche-ComtÃ©, working on my thesis titled "Multi-scale mathematical modeling and numerical and analytical approaches for keloid diseases". My research interests include numerical and analytical approaches to study differential equation models with applications in biology and medicine, as well as data science and machine learning approaches to data classification, model building, and deployment.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- My PhD thesis at UniversitÃ© de Bourgogne Franche-ComtÃ©.
- Numerical and analytical approaches to study differential equation models.
- Machine learning and deep learning models for medical data.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Advanced machine learning techniques.
- New methods in data visualization.
- Furthering my knowledge in numerical analysis.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
- Research projects related to mathematical modeling and data science.
- Machine learning applications in biology and medicine.
- Open-source projects that need expertise in Python, R, or MATLAB.

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m open to
- Collaborations on publications and research.
- Networking with other professionals in my field.
- Finding opportunities to present my research.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
